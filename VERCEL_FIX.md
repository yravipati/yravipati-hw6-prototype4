# 🔧 Fixing the 404 Error on Vercel

## Why You Got the 404 Error

The 404 error happened because:
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Your app has `client/` and `server/` folders, but Vercel was looking in the wrong place
2. **Build Configuration**: The initial `vercel.json` wasn't properly configured for this structure
3. **Static Files**: The frontend build wasn't being served correctly

## ✅ What I Fixed

I've updated the configuration files:
- ✅ Updated `vercel.json` with correct paths
- ✅ Added proper build commands
- ✅ Configured rewrites for API and frontend

## 🚀 How to Redeploy (2 Options)

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to Your Project**: https://vercel.com/yravipati/yravipati-hw6-prototype4
2. **Settings → General**
3. **Framework Preset**: Select "Other"
4. **Build & Development Settings**:
   - Build Command: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `client/build`
   - Install Command: `npm install --prefix client && npm install --prefix server`
5. **Save**
6. **Go to Deployments** → Click "..." on latest → **Redeploy**

### Option 2: Push Updated Config to GitHub

```bash
# I'll commit and push the fixes for you
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Update Vercel configuration for monorepo"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-redeploy with the new config!

## 🛠️ Alternative: Deploy Frontend Only First

If you want to test just the frontend working first:

### Step 1: Create Separate Vercel Project for Frontend
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import: `yravipati-hw6-prototype4`
3. **Root Directory**: Set to `client`
4. Framework: Create React App (auto-detected)
5. Deploy

This will get your frontend live immediately!

### Step 2: Deploy Backend Separately (Later)
You can deploy the backend to:
- **Railway**: https://railway.app (recommended for backend)
- **Render**: https://render.com
- **Heroku**: https://heroku.com

Then update the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable in Vercel to point to your backend.

## 🎯 Recommended Approach: Split Deployment

For monorepos, it's often easier to deploy separately:

### Frontend (Vercel)
```bash
# Deploy only the client folder
cd client
vercel --prod
```

### Backend (Railway - Free & Easy)
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Select your repo
4. **Root Directory**: `server`
5. Add environment variables (database, etc.)
6. Deploy

### Update Frontend to Use Backend
In Vercel → Your Frontend Project → Settings → Environment Variables:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api
```

## 📋 Quick Fix Commands

Let me push the updated configuration to GitHub:

```bash
git add vercel.json package.json VERCEL_FIX.md
git commit -m "fix: Update Vercel configuration to fix 404 error"
git push origin main
```

After this, go to Vercel and redeploy!

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

Once redeployed, check:
1. **Homepage**: Should load React app
2. **API Health**: Visit `your-url.vercel.app/api/health`
3. **Survey**: Should work end-to-end

## 💡 Pro Tip: Separate Deployments

For production apps, it's best practice to:
- **Frontend** → Vercel (optimized for React)
- **Backend** → Railway/Render (optimized for Node.js + DB)
- **Database** → Supabase/Railway Postgres

This gives you:
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Easier debugging
- ✅ Independent scaling
- ✅ Simpler configuration

## 🆘 Still Getting 404?

Try this simple approach:

1. **Delete the Vercel project**
2. **Create new Vercel project**
3. **Root Directory**: Set to `client` only
4. **Framework**: Create React App
5. **Deploy**

This deploys ONLY the frontend first. You can add the backend later!
